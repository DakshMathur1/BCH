## Inspiration

A recent study revealed that the average American spends a staggering $129 per month on subscription services, with a significant portion going towards unused or forgotten subscriptions and overdue charges. Shockingly, when asked about their perceived spending, respondents estimated only $86, highlighting a substantial disconnect. This underscores the critical need for effective subscription management platforms like ScriptO.

However, we recognize the existing market is saturated. ScriptO differentiates itself by not only focusing on financial well-being but also on fostering a healthy relationship between users and subscription services. We understand that unsubscribing isn't always permanent. Users often return when content or features pique their interest. For example, a compelling movie release could reignite a user's interest in a streaming service. ScriptO aims to facilitate this by providing notifications about upcoming content that aligns with user preferences, encouraging them to resubscribe when their financial situation improves.
